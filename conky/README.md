### .conkyrc

You'll need both Fonts Installed. so Roboto and Material Icons, If you want the CryptoTicker's you'll need Cryptofont as well.

Next you need to store the .conkyrc file in your home directory. Here's the link to my .conkyrc. You might need to modify it to suit your system.

Change the Wired and Wireless connection names. my Ethernet is called "enp0s25" and Wifi is "wlp3s0", so Replace them with yours.

Same with the power supply, it might be different.

For the cryptoTicker to work you'll need Python installed and the scripts I created. ltcPrice.py + rxpPrice.py (Their basically the same except a few values, that you could change to suit).

Of course you could just comment out the bits you don't want. Hope that Helps.
